## Password_creator
It is a little handmade software to create a random password for your usages.

This code was made to generate pssword from 8 to 16 characters with letters (lower case and capital), digits and special characters (punctuation, symbols...).

Here you can find the all Python code of it in the file:
* password_generator.py

# For the application:

You can find in the dist folder the .exe than you can download and use for what you need.

⚠️ It was done on Windows, so it works only on Windows OS !

Don't forget to download all in dist folder (.exe and image) to have the application working well.
